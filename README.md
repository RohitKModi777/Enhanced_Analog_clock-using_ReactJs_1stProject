# React Analog Clock

This small React + Vite app implements a smooth, responsive analog clock with controls to set a custom time. Setting a time will move the needle to that time and the clock will continue running from the set time. You can revert to system time at any point.

How to run (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\modiu\OneDrive\Desktop\WEB Dev Game\Clock"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the server address printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- Inputs accept hours (0-23), minutes (0-59) and seconds (0-59).
- Press "Set Time" to set a custom running time. Press "Use System Time" to go back to the real clock.
